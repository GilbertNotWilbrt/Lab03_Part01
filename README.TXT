This project is part of the material for the book

It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class NumberDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as increment and setValue.

doesn't change. I believe this is because it won't input the value as it is
bigger than 6 which it refuses to recognize.
